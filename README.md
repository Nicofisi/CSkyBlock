==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicofisi/cskyblock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicofisi/cskyblock)

A Skyblock Bukkit plugin for Minecraft derived from the well-known BSkyBlock and ASkyBlock!
This is a survival game where the player starts with an island in the sky.

CSkyBlock (CkySkyBlock) represents a turning point on BSkyBlock's history : Tastybento and Poslovitch thought and designed together this complete rewrite in order to provide a whole new way to play Skyblock.
